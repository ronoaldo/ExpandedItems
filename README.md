ExpandedItems
=============

Simple Minecraft extension to vanilla, with some expanded
functionality for undesired items.

This project provides the following resources:
* Minecraft Java Data and Resource Packs: can be used to play
  in single player as well as hosted on a server with automated
  resource pack downloads.
* Minecraft Bedrock Resrouce Pack and Geyser Mappings JSON: can be added
  to a [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/) installation to allow
  Minecraft Bedrock players to join the party as well.

## Features

The first addition is the `Copper Shovel`, which is crafted with two sticks
and a Copper Ingot. It can be used just like an Iron Shovel, however it lasts
a bit longer.

More items will be added soon.
